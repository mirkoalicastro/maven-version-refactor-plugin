<p>Helps to refactor a Maven <strong>pom.xml</strong> replacing inline dependencies versions with a dedicated property.</p>
<p>This IntelliJ plugin adds an intention action that suggests extraction of a dependency version in a pom using a property.<br />
    It adds an entry to <strong>Preferences | Editor | Intentions | SDK Intentions</strong>.<br />
    It is a high priority action, enabled when the cursor is on a non-variable dependency version (both on text and tag).
