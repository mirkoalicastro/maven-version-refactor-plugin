# maven-version-refactor-plugin

This IntelliJ plugin adds an intention action that suggests extraction of a dependency version in a pom using a property.

It adds an entry to **Preferences | Editor | Intentions | SDK Intentions**.

It is a *high priority action*, enabled when the cursor is on a non-variable dependency version (both on text and tag).
